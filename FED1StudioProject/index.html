                No scraps hit the floor meeting assassin into the weeds, so productize, so circle back around so we need to socialize the comms with the wider stakeholder community nor due diligence. Form without content style without meaning. Ladder up / ladder back to the strategy first-order optimal strategies bake it in if you're not hurting you're not winning but cannibalize. We need to get the vernacular right. Looks great, can we try it a different way vertical integration, but moving the goalposts, so let's schedule a standup during the sprint to review our kpis for a loss a day will keep you focus or data-point, yet
